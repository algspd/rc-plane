rc-plane - version 2
========

Version 2 of the plane.
Born from the need to use a lighter and printable fuselage. Also uses a lighter tail.

First flight
------------
The plane flyes but it rolls to the left. It may be caused by small differences between the wings.
The pitch is a bit excessive, by lightly touching the remote, the plane goes too up/down.
The wings incidence is not ok, must be a bit higher.
