rc-plane
========

Freely available openscad designs of an rc-plane
It's my first attemp to print an rc-plane and at the time of this writing is still untested.
Feel free to use, modify and share this sketches.

Version1: I tried to make the fuselage printable, but it resulted in a too big part, and It's not printable (although, if you can print it light enough, it may fly).

Version2: Born from the need to use a lighter and printable fuselage. Also uses a lighter tail.
